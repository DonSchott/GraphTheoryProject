# What has to be done

- read the stuff noted in resources.md, again
- theory is fascinating, but try not to overdo binge reading
- make notes for the relevant vocabulary; create a second brain with obsidian
- play around with state of the art graph (visualisation) frameworks and create Jupyter notebooks
- bonus: create Jupyter or Streamlit Dashboards that enable easier collaboration

- Set short collaborative goals. Pick a small, tangible subproblem: e.g., compute the exact number of r-edge colorings of small graphs avoiding rainbow K4.
  Small goals and small successes will help with focus and motivation
- Schedule regular theory–code syncs. Regular calls will make sure to stay on track and motivate.

# Outlook and goals for cooperation
How can I help with my interest and skill in numerical methods, programming and computation? In several ways:

1. Computational Experimentation to help Mathematicians find hypotheses (that they than can happily prove)
   - Test extremal hypotheses for small graphs using randomized edge colorings.
   - Empirical exploration of threshold behavior (e.g., where structure shifts from Turán to non-Turán optimality).
   - Use Monte Carlo methods to explore configurations beyond analytical reach.
2. Automated Proof Assistants (helps them with proving)
   - Develop automated checking tools for small graph instances or edge-coloring constraints. This might help with the (more general) proofs.
   - For example: Find maximal graphs that avoid certain subgraph color patterns.
3. Visualization Tools
   - Build interactive visualizations of coloring spaces, extremal graphs, or partition structures -- This could also help generate intuition for
     future conjectures or proof strategies.
4. Numerical Exploration of Thresholds
   - Determine minimal values of r for various forbidden patterns using brute force or heuristics.
   - This might be a low hanging fruit to get first upper/lower bounds for certain problems

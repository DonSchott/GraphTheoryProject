A *graph* is an object consisting of two [[set]]s called its *vertex set* and its *edge set*. The vertex set is a finite nonempty set. The edge set may be empty, but otherwise ist elements are two-element subsets of the vertex set.

See [[vertices and edges]]
## Example
The sets $\{P, Q, R, S, T, U\}$ and $\{\{P, Q\}, \{P, R\}, \{Q,R\}, \{S,U\}\}$ constitute a graph *G*.

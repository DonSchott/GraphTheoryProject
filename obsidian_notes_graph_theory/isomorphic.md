Two [[graph]]s are said to be *isomorphic* if there exists between their vertex sets a one-to-one correspondence having the property that whenever two vertices are adjacent in either graph, the corresponding two vertices are adjacent in the other graph. Such a one-two-one correspondence is called an *isomorphism*. If G and H are isomorphic graphs we denote this by writing "$G \cong H$".

## Books

My starting point is the excellent *Introduction to GRAPH THEORY* by **Richard Trudeau**. 
Graph Theory in general is about hundred years old. The book is from the 1970s and teaches the theory in a concise and approachable way.
Excellent for amateurs and physicists as me.

## Internet links

I skimmed wikipedia articles such as [Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), 
[Extremal graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremal_graph_theory), 
[Graph coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring) and 
[Edge Coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_coloring) to get another 
feel for the history and fundamental findings and topics of the field. 
Less concise as the book -- as most wikipedia articles the content was written about ten or twenty years ago.

## Research papers
To prepare my colloboration and finally win a Fields medal and/or Nobel price for literature, I want to work with and understand these two papers:
[EDGE-COLORINGS AVOIDING PATTERNS IN A TRIANGLE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.06991) and [MAXIMUM NUMBER OF EDGE COLORINGS AVOIDING RAINBOW
COPIES OF K4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19244).
